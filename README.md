>### Purpose

My portfolio website serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences as a soon to be developer. Its primary purpose is to provide visitors with a comprehensive overview of who I am, what I do, and the value I can bring to potential collaborations or job opportunities.

>### Functionality and Features

1. ***Navigation Menu***

```Hamburger Toggle```: My portfolio includes a responsive navigation menu with a hamburger toggle for small screens, providing an intuitive user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
```Dropdown Menu```: It also features a dropdown menu for accessing various sections of the website, ensuring easy navigation when in mobile view.  

2. ***Project Display***

```Project Boxes```: Each project will be displayed in a dedicated box with an image, project title, and a link to the project's GitHub repository. This organised layout allows users to quickly access project details.

3. ***Project Details***

```Project Stack Icons```: For each project, there are animated icons representing the technologies and languages used. Users can easily identify the tech stack employed in each project. There is also a short Project description explaining its purpose and key features.

4. ***Social Links***

```GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram Links```: Links to my social profiles on GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram are available above the footer on every page for users to easily connect or contact me.

5. ***Responsive Design***

```Fully Responsive```: My portfolio is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices. It ensures a consistent and pleasant user experience across all platforms.

6. ***Minimalist Design***

```Modern and Minimalistic```: My portfolio features a modern and minimalistic design with smooth sublte animations and a spinning name logo.

7. ***Code Quality***

```Clean HTML and CSS```: The HTML and CSS codebase adheres to best practices, ensuring clean and maintainable code for future updates and improvements.

8. ***Presentation***

```Clean and organised Layout```: My blog layout offers a clean and organised presentation of blog posts, ensuring readability and easy navigation for visitors. Each blog post is showcased with a featured image and a short description enticing readers to click on the content. ```Read more links``` are on each of the blog posts with arrow icons encouraging users to open the individual blog posts. I have also incorporated author information below each blog post with a small photo next to the name and date. 

9. ***Interactive Tech Stack***

```Spinning Tech Stack Icons```: On my home page, there is an interactive tech stack section with spinning icons. This feature not only adds visual appeal but also provides information about the technologies I am currently familiar with. Additionally, I have used CSS filters and grayed-out icons for the technologies I am not yet 
familiar with when hovered over for transparency.
